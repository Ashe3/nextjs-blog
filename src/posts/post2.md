# Understanding JavaScript Closures

A **closure** is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are powerful and fundamental for many JavaScript patterns.

## How Do Closures Work?

Let’s break it down with an example:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // Enclosing variable

  return function() {
    count += 1; // Inner function accessing the outer variable
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
console.log(counter()); // 3

Here’s what’s happening:
	•	The createCounter function defines a local variable count.
	•	The returned function (closure) retains access to the count variable even after createCounter has finished executing.

Where Are Closures Useful?
1.	Data Encapsulation
Closures can create private variables:

function Person(name) {
  return {
    getName: () => name,
  };
}

const person = Person("Alice");
console.log(person.getName()); // Alice


2.	Event Handlers
Closures retain references to variables when handling events:

function registerHandler(buttonId) {
  let clicks = 0;
  document.getElementById(buttonId).addEventListener("click", () => {
    clicks++;
    console.log(`Button clicked ${clicks} times`);
  });
}


3.	Currying
Closures are essential for creating curried functions:

const add = (a) => (b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5)(10)); // 15



Conclusion

Closures may seem tricky at first, but once you understand them, they become an indispensable tool in your JavaScript arsenal. They allow you to write clean, modular, and powerful code.
